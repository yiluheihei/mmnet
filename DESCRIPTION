Description: This package gives the implementations microbiome metabolic
    network constructing and analyzing. It introduces a unique metagenomic
    systems biology approach, mapping metagenomic data to the KEGG global
    metabolic pathway and constructing a systems-level network. The
    system-level network and the next topological analysis will be of great
    help to analysis the various functional properties, including regulation
    and metabolic functionality of the metagenome.
